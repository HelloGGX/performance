# 利用 DMAIC 进行结构化性能优化

Wondering what DMAIC looks like in action?
Here's an example:

Define the Problem: Users report long app load times.
Goal: Reduce load time by 50% within three months.
Measure: The current average load time is 8 seconds.
Analyze: Splash screen assets load slowly; API calls delay UI rendering.
Improve: Preload critical assets, use lazy loading, and convert to asynchronous API calls.
Result: Load time reduced to 4 seconds.
Control: Set up continuous regression monitoring.
