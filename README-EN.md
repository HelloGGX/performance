# react-performance-optimization

## Project Overview and Usage Instructions
- **README.md**: Project introduction and usage instructions.

## Code Splitting
- **dynamic-import**: Dynamically import modules to improve application load performance.
- **lazy-loading**: Lazy load components or modules on demand to reduce initial load time.
- **route-based-splitting**: Route-based code splitting to load code as needed based on routes.
- **splitting-large-package**: Split large packages to avoid loading too much code at once.

## Rendering Optimization
- **avoid-re-renders**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders to improve rendering performance.
- **use-memo**: Use `useMemo` to optimize performance by memoizing values and avoiding unnecessary calculations.
- **use-callback**: Use `useCallback` to optimize performance by memoizing functions and avoiding unnecessary function creation.
- **use-transition**: Use `useTransition` to implement concurrent mode and improve UI responsiveness.
- **list-virtualization**: List virtualization to enhance long list rendering performance.
  - **react-virtualized**: Use `react-virtualized` for list virtualization.
  - **vue-virtualized**: Use `vue-virtualized` for list virtualization.
- **concurrent-mode**: Concurrent mode to improve application responsiveness.

## Performance Monitoring
- **react-profiler**: Use React Profiler for performance monitoring and analysis.
- **web-vitals**: Collect and report Core Web Vitals metrics to monitor page performance.
- **lighthouse**: Use Lighthouse for web performance analysis and optimization suggestions.

## Network Optimization
- **data-fetching**: Optimize data fetching to improve data loading efficiency.
  - **react-query**: Use `react-query` for data fetching and caching.
  - **swr**: Use `swr` for data fetching and caching.
- **caching**: Optimize caching to reduce network requests and improve load speed.
- **cdn-usage**: Use CDNs to serve resources and improve load speeds.
- **http2**: Use the HTTP/2 protocol to improve network transfer efficiency.

## Image Optimization
- **lazy-load**: Lazy load images to improve initial page load speed.
  - **react-lazyload**: Use `react-lazyload` for image lazy loading.
- **responsive-images**: Use responsive images to load different sizes based on device and screen size.
- **modern-formats**: Use modern image formats (e.g., WebP) to improve image load and render speed.
- **image-compression**: Compress images to reduce file size and improve load speed.

## Dependency Optimization
- **bundle-analyzer**: Use a bundle analyzer to analyze and optimize bundle size.
- **tree-shaking**: Use tree shaking to remove unused code and reduce bundle size.
- **import-optimization**: Optimize module imports to reduce bundle size and load time.

## Server-Side Rendering
- **nextjs**: Use Next.js for server-side rendering to improve application performance.
- **custom-ssr**: Custom server-side rendering to enhance performance and SEO.
- **ssr-caching**: Server-side rendering caching to improve rendering speed and performance.

## Other Optimization
- **preloading-prefetching**: Preload and prefetch resources to improve page load speed.
- **web-workers**: Use Web Workers to execute tasks in the background and improve application responsiveness.
- **code-minification**: Minify code to reduce file size and improve load speed.
- **accessibility-optimization**: Optimize accessibility to improve user experience.
